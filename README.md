# Langmuir Probe Payload Software FPGA Code - Rudolfs Arvids Kalnins Master Thesis 2024
This repository contains the code written for the Master Thesis of Rudolfs Arvids Kalnins at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
## Thesis Title 
Instrument software development for Langmuir probe onboard ROMEO satellite
## Code based on
SPIDER2 DataHub Code
## Description
The code contains the FPGA part of the Langmuir Probe Payload software.
The code is synthesized, compiled, programmed, and tested using Microsemi Libero SoC v11.9 SP6
The Langmuir Probe Payload is a part of the ROMEO mission.
A detailed description of the software is available in the Master Thesis document.
